        <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
        <p><h4>Choux Pastries:</h4></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, let's make the choux batter. In a pot, combine the water, butter and a pinch of salt, and turn on the burner.</li>
                <li>Bring it to a boil on medium heat. When the butter is completely melted and it reaches a rolling boil, turn off the burner.</li>
                <li>Add the sieved cake flour to the pot. Quickly stir the mixture.</li>
                <li>When the flour has absorbed the water evenly and the mixture begins to turn gooey, turn on the burner again. Continue to stir the mixture on medium heat until a thin film forms on the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Place the mixture into a bowl. Flatten it with a spatula and slightly cool to avoid cooking the egg. Then, gradually add the beaten egg in 4 to 5 steps. When the egg is completely absorbed, begin adding another portion.</li>
                <li>Achieving the perfect consistency is essential to making presentable choux pastries. To prevent the batter from getting too thin, add the egg a little at a time when it reaches the final stage.</li>
                <li>Drop the batter from the spatula as shown to check the consistency.</li>
                <li>When the choux batter left hanging forms a “V” shape, it is the perfect consistency.</li>
                <li>Next, dust the edge of a 5cm (2") diameter cup with any type of flour or starch. Then, as a rough guide, make 12 circles where the choux batter will be placed on the parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Put the batter into a pastry bag.</li>
                <li>Hold the bag 1cm (0.5") above the circle and squeeze the batter into a round shape. Repeat the process, filling each of the markers.</li>
                <li>Dampen your finger with water and press each peak of the batter, adjusting the shape. Finally, mist the batter with water thoroughly to help avoid drying.</li>
                <li>Place the baking sheet into the oven preheated to 200 °C (390 °F) and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove the baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Place the choux pastries onto a cooling rack and cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p><h4>Pastry Cream (net weight 500g/1.1lb)</h4></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Let’s make the pastry cream. Cut the vanilla bean pod in half lengthwise and scrape it with the back of a knife, extracting the seeds.</li>
                <li>Then, add the seeds and pod to the milk, mix and gradually heat it on low heat. When it begins to boil, turn off the burner.</li>
                <li>Next, lightly beat 4 egg yolks in a bowl and add the sugar.</li>
                <li>Mix the egg yolk with a balloon whisk until it begins to lighten in color.</li>
                <li>Combine the cake flour and corn starch, and sieve onto a sheet of paper. Add it to the egg yolk and combine the mixture.</li>
                <li>Add one-third of the milk to the bowl, diluting the egg yolk. Make sure to add the milk film and vanilla seeds.</li>
                <li>Then, using a mesh strainer, strain the egg yolk into the pot of the milk. Turn on the burner. Continue mixing the pastry cream until it thickens.</li>
                <li>When it begins to form bubbles, turn off the burner.</li>
                <li>Place the pastry cream into a tray chilled with ice.</li>
                <li>Cover it with plastic wrap. Pastry cream spoils easily so cool it as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>Add the sugar to a bowl of whipping cream. Whip the cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Lightly mix the chilled pastry cream in a bowl to soften.</li>
                <li>Add the whipped cream and combine.</li>
                <li>We recommend adding two-thirds of the whipped cream but you can adjust the amount to taste. Mix to combine.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p><h4>Choux Creme</h4></p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a diagonal cut in each choux pastry.</li>
                <li>Put the pastry cream into a bag. Give it a little squeeze to remove the air inside. Open the pastry and squeeze a generous amount of the cream into it. You can also simplify the filling process by spooning the cream into the pastries.</li>
                <li>Finally, sprinkle the powdered sugar over them.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
